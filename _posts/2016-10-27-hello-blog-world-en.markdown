## Hello Blog World

Finally, I make my mind to write blogs. After years of reading and learning. I just keep consuming, now it's time for me to producing.

A little bit weird for me to write in English, but I will try to keep going.

By the way, thanks to Github, Jekyll and Markdown. And thanks to [Ben](https://github.com/itisbenjamin/Nice_Blog) for this simple theme. I've changed a little bit and added 
multiple language supports.
